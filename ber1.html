Weapon: Dragonslayer (massive greatsword)<br>

Personality<br>
Guts is defined by his unyielding willpower and determination to keep fighting no matter the odds. He’s stubborn, hot-headed, and often brutally honest. Despite his rage and violent nature, he deeply cares for his companions and especially protects Casca, the woman he loves. He embodies the theme of “struggling against fate.”<br>

Background<br>
Guts was born from the corpse of his mother, and raised by mercenaries in a cruel world. From a young age, he learned how to fight to survive, wielding weapons larger than himself. He eventually joined Griffith’s Band of the Hawk, where he became one of the strongest warriors and Griffith’s right hand. After the Eclipse (a tragic event where Griffith sacrifices the Hawks), Guts is branded with the Brand of Sacrifice, marking him as prey for demons. Since then, he has been on a journey of vengeance against Griffith and the God Hand.<br>
